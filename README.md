	```

3. Add this upstream mediawiki repo

    ```bash
    $ cd mediawiki
    $ git remote add upstream -m master https://github.com/Lux-Vacuos/mediawiki.git
    $ git pull -s recursive -X theirs upstream master
	```

4. Then push the repo upstream

.openshift/action_hooks/build - Script that gets run every push, just prior to starting your app.


# Notes about layout
Please leave  data directory but feel free to create additional directories if needed.

Note: Every time you push, everything inside the wiki dir gets recreated please store long term items (like an sqlite database) in the root directory or another directory which will persist between pushes of your repo.

# pear.txt

A list of pears to install, line by line on the server.  This will happen when the user git pushes.
